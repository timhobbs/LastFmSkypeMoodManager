Last.fm Skype Mood Manager
==========================

With the old Last.fm desktop app, they had an integration with Skype so that it could auto-update your "mood" message with a "now playing" message. I always liked that, but for whatever reason it is not in the new Last.fm app (which sucks, BTW. Not just the lack of Skype integration, but the desktop app itself).

I started out to create a Windows service that would perform the same function. Initially, I created a console app, which works as expected. I stopped just short of completing the service because I realized the desktop app sucks (see previous paragraph) and since I don't use the desktop app for radio (because it requires a subscription) I don't really have a need for the mood manager thing anymore.

So here it is - in its non-glorious state. Maybe if you are a Last.fm subscriber you could take the last couple steps to finish up the service bits and get this working? Maybe not? Maybe no one cares?
